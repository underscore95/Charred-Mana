# Charred Mana

Charred Mana is a turn-based tactical survivors-like where the world's mana has been corrupted, summoning hordes of monsters. Cast spells, upgrade your stats, and master the ways of magic to survive as long as possible. Become stronger with every run.

Can you reach the final floor and destroy the Ashkara, the corrupted legendary stone at the heart of the corruption?
